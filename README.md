Code Challenges


For each of the challenges below, create a new method in a single Console application. 
All of your code should live in the Program.cs file. 
Utilize the Main() method to call each challenge method, you may create additional external methods as appropriate.
Each challenge should be it's own branch. 
Practice using your git work flow during the construction of this project. 
Refer to the git work flow doc as a reference.

Problem 1: Array Max Result
Problem Statement
Given an array select a number that exists, and output the computated "score". 
The method you create should take in both an array of integers and the integer the user selected.

Create a Console application that requests 5 numbers between 1-10 from the user. Output the array to the console and ask the user to select a number. After the selection, output the "score" of the number chosen.

Selection and Scoring Algorithm
You can select any number from the list, however your scoring will be depend on the frequency of that number in the list. E.g for [2,2,3,5,4] if you pick 2 your score will be 4 (2 * 2) but if you pick 5 your score will be 5 (5 * 1)

Input Format
An array of integers, and the number chosen.

Sample Input
[6,4,4,1,3] , 4

Sample Output
8
